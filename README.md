## Updates

### 2022-07-??

#### Changes

- Moved korok A34 to Tarrey Town 3.

- Fixed gale routing (for the most part).

- Moved late game furies to the last Frost Talus.

### 2022-07-04

#### Changes

- Moved F07 (light chase in Koto Pond) from Eventide branch to Faron branch. It's now after F06 (lift rock on Breman Peak) instead of after warp to Hateno Tower.

- Changed fury routing between Pumaag Nitae and Central Tower.

- Moved koroks C58 and C59 back to Gerudo Canyon branch. Had been moved to Central Tower branch for fury timing.

- Korok D03 (apple offering outside Impa's) is moved to Kakariko 3 to be done during Lakna Rokee. This would put us down one korok for Hestu 2, but...

- Korok P09 (confetti in Shrine of Resurrection) is moved to the end of Hestu 1 to account for the loss of D03. This is made possible after deciding to warp out of SoR rather than doing the scope clip.

- Koroks A42 and A43 are moved to right after warping to Akkala Tower rather than windbombing and using two gales after A45.

- Added steps to get a Swift Carrot at Highland Stable (Koko's Kitchen) and a Baked Apple at the old man's hut (Apple of My Eye).

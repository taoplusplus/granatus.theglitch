# Corrupted Granatus

## Route Notes

### Directions

The directions to objectives are noted using compass cardinal (North, South, East, West) and ordinal (NorthEast, SouthEast, SouthWest, NorthWest) directions along with "left" and "right" modifiers: `<<`, `<`, `.`, `>`, and `>>`.

For example, the notation `N>` means "look North, rotate a little bit to the right" or more succintly, "aim right of North".

The difference between `N.`, `N>`, and `N>>` is a matter of degree with `N.` indicating a tiny amount of rotation to the right of north and `N>>` indicating a more substantial turn.

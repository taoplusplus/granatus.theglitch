## Updates

### 2022-07-19

- Revised route to use an optimized dupe strategy (thanks minghao!).
	- Only 3 bows before dupe.
	- Get wooden bow by Z38.
- Added a strat to clear inventory corruption after N48.
- Added splits for entering divine beasts and Kohga.
- Moved guardian scout picture to Hawa Koth, guardian stalker picture to after C33.

### 2022-07-14

- Moved second heart turn-in to Kakariko 3 during Dorian escort.
- Revised the whole route doc from beginning to end.

### 2022-07-09

- Made the Plateau route more efficient:
	- Skip the 4 tree branches at the beginning.
	- Grab a flint down the hill (no longer need to rely on rng flint from mushroom woods or go to the backup location before Farosh).
	- Upon reloading the save:
		- Drop flint.
		- Run back toward Shrine of Resurrection and pick up the 4 tree branches.
		- Enter Shrine of Resurrection to trigger auto-save.

- Switched to corrupting 999 fairies instead of hearty bass.
	- The new process ends with 8 Lizalfos Horns (1 short) and 15 Silent Princesses (4 short)
	- Noted places to make up the 1 Lizalfos Horn
	- For the Silent Princesses, grab 3 next to the Master Sword and 1 in Zelda's Study

- No longer get max hearts/stamina in Hateno. Now only max stamina and rely on fairies for healing. This requires turning in hearts in two other locations:
	- In Korok Forest to get the required 13 hearts for Master Sword.
	- In Rito Village lategame to fulfill the 100% requirement to have max container upgrades.

- All non-Blessing, non-Test-of-Strength shrines now have links for their shrine strats.

### 2022-07-06

- Added links to resources at the top of the route.

### 2022-07-05

- Moved korok A34 to Tarrey Town 3.
- Fixed gale routing (for the most part).
- Moved late game furies to the last Frost Talus.

### 2022-07-04

- Moved F07 (light chase in Koto Pond) from Eventide branch to Faron branch. It's now after F06 (lift rock on Breman Peak) instead of after warp to Hateno Tower.

- Changed fury routing between Pumaag Nitae and Central Tower.

- Moved koroks C58 and C59 back to Gerudo Canyon branch. Had been moved to Central Tower branch for fury timing.

- Korok D03 (apple offering outside Impa's) is moved to Kakariko 3 to be done during Lakna Rokee. This would put us down one korok for Hestu 2, but...

- Korok P09 (confetti in Shrine of Resurrection) is moved to the end of Hestu 1 to account for the loss of D03. This is made possible after deciding to warp out of SoR rather than doing the scope clip.

- Koroks A42 and A43 are moved to right after warping to Akkala Tower rather than windbombing and using two gales after A45.

- Added steps to get a Swift Carrot at Highland Stable (Koko's Kitchen) and a Baked Apple at the old man's hut (Apple of My Eye).
